Whether to display First / Last buttons\ndirectionLinks: Whether to display Previous / Next buttons\nmaxSize: Limit number for pagination size\nrotate: Whether to keep the current page in the middle of the visible ones\nboundaryLinkNumbers: Whether to always display the first and last page numbers. If max-size is smaller than the number of pages, then the first and last page numbers are still shown with ellipses in-between as necessary. NOTE: max-size refers to the center of the range. This option may add up to 2 more numbers on each side of the displayed range for the end value and what would be an ellipsis but is replaced by a number because it is sequential\nforceEllipses: Also displays ellipses when rotate is true and maxSize is smaller than the number of pages\nsize: Sets the size of pagination when bootstrap 4 is being used. Can accept only two values either sm or lg.
