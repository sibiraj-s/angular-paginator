Component\nPaginator component accepts\n\n\nid: Use unique id when multiple paginations are being used on the same page\nboundaryLinks: Whether to display First / Last buttons\ndirectionLinks: Whether to display Previous / Next buttons\nmaxSize: Limit number for pagination size\nrotate: Whether to keep the current page in the middle of the visible ones\nboundaryLinkNumbers: Whether to always display the first and last page numbers. If max-size is smaller than the number of pages, then the first and last page numbers are still shown with ellipses in-between as necessary. NOTE: max-size refers to the center of the range. This option may add up to 2 more numbers on each side of the displayed range for the end value and what would be an ellipsis but is replaced by a number because it is sequential\nforceEllipses: Also displays ellipses when rotate is true and maxSize is smaller than the number of pages\nsize: Sets the size of pagination when bootstrap 4 is being used. Can accept only two values either sm or lg. Check Bootstrap 4 docs for more details.\nclassName: Adds custom class to the pagination element\nfirstText: Text for First button\npreviousText: Text for Previous button\nnextText: Text for Next button\nlastText: Text for Last button\nautoHide: Hides the pagination component if items length is less than itemsPerPage\ndisabled: Disables pagination component\n\nDemo\nDemo at stackblitz angular-paginator\nDocumentation\nDocumentation is auto-generated using compodoc, and can be viewed here: https://sibiraj-s.github.io/angular-paginator/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017-2018 Sibiraj\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
